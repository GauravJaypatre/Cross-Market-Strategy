# Cross-Market Strategy Backtest & Friction Impact Report

**Strategy Parsing Method:** `Deterministic Rule-Based Parser`

**Random Seed:** `42` (Deterministic Monte Carlo & Bootstrap Resampling)

**Tax & Brokerage Dataset Status:** `Reference / Preliminary Baseline (primary_statutory_single_source)`

> **Strategy Description**: *"Buy when the index closes above its upper Bollinger Band, using a 20-day moving average and 2 standard deviations. Sell when it closes back below the 20-day moving average. No leverage, no shorting."*

## Methodological Disclosures

> [!NOTE]
> **Sharpe Annualization & Risk-Free Rate**: Sharpe ratios are calculated from daily returns using an annualization factor of sqrt(252) (252 trading days/year) and an annualized risk-free rate of 0.0%. This stated simplification avoids confounding 15 divergent sovereign yield curves over the 2011–2025 period. Cross-market risk-adjusted capital efficiency should also be evaluated via the Calmar ratio and net excess CAGR over Buy & Hold.


> [!NOTE]
> **Robustness Methodology (Sequence Risk vs Estimation Uncertainty)**: The Monte Carlo trade-shuffle (1,000 permutations) randomizes trade execution order to isolate sequence risk and path-dependent drawdown (P95), whereas the bootstrap confidence interval resamples trade returns with replacement to quantify parameter estimation uncertainty on annualized CAGR given small sample size (n < 30).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Currency Standard & Stated Limitation**: Rankings are computed within each currency's own terms (no FX adjustment); cross-country comparison does not account for exchange-rate fluctuations.


> [!WARNING]
> **Dataset Verification Notice**: Reference / Preliminary Baseline (Curated from statutory authorities e.g. IRS, HMRC, Indian Finance Acts; tagged as primary_statutory_single_source until user-supplied cross-verified datasets are provided).


> [!CAUTION]
> **Low-Sample Precision Notice**: Sample Size & Statistical Precision Notice (Low-n, Directional Only): Strategy trade counts range from 7 to 13 trades across the 2011–2025 period. Because n < 30, individual index CAGR estimates carry wide 95% bootstrap confidence intervals and must be interpreted as directional rather than definitive alpha.


## 1. Primary Ranking: Net-of-Tax-and-Discount-Brokerage CAGR

Qualified indices sorted by Net Discount CAGR. All four friction tracks and the Buy & Hold benchmark are displayed side by side.

## 2. Secondary Ranking: Calmar Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Efficiency)

Re-sorted by Calmar Ratio (CAGR / |Max Drawdown|) computed on the Net-of-Tax-and-Discount-Brokerage series.


| Calmar Rank | Country | Index | Calmar Ratio | Net-Disc CAGR | Max Drawdown | Sharpe | Total Trades |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | United States | Dow Jones Industrial Average | **0.05** | 0.85% | -16.75% | 0.16 | 62 |

## 3. Skeptical Robustness & Overfitting Evaluation

In-Sample (2011–2018) vs Out-of-Sample (2019–2025) performance degradation, 1,000 Monte Carlo trade sequence permutations, and 95% bootstrap CAGR confidence intervals.


| Country | Index | IS CAGR (2011-18) | OOS CAGR (2019-25) | Degradation (OOS/IS) | IS Trades | OOS Trades | IS Guard | OOS Guard | MC Worst DD (P95) | 95% Bootstrap CI | Precision Flag |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| United States | Dow Jones Industrial Average | 0.64% | 1.09% | 1.71x (+0.45 pp) | 32 | 30 | PASS | PASS | -13.14% | [-0.3%, 4.4%] | `Robust (n>=30)` |
